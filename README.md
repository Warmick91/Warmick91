### Hello there! üëã

My name is Krzysztof, and I don't think there's a single box that I can quite fit into. I am an IHK-certified software developer, hold a Master's Degree in instrumental music (double bass), have traveled the world with one of the most prestigious orchestras on this planet, and have also worked with a circus. I love philosophy, appreciate sci-fi in its purest form, and consider J.R.R. Tolkien the literary master.

- üå± Currently focusing on Fullstack (Angular, .NET, SQL, Azure). I like to play with Unity now and then too.
- üî≠ Working on a personal project, "The Click Pot"
- üåç Human Languages: Polish (native), English (C2), German (B2)
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I'm an invested gamer focusing on single-player, narrative-heavy titles
